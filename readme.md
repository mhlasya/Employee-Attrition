INTRODUCTION:
Employee attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced.
Attrition is an inevitable part of any business. There will come a time when an employee wants to leave your company – for either personal or professional reasons. But when attrition crosses a particular threshold, it becomes a cause for concern. For example, attrition among minority employee groups could be hurting diversity at your organization. Or, attrition among senior leaders can lead to a significant gap in organizational leadership.
